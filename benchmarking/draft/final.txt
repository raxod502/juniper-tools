      Benchmarking Methodology for IPv6 Routing Extension Headers       
               draft-clinic-ipv6-ext-hdr-bench-method-00                

Abstract

   This document specifies a test procedure that should be used to
   evaluate the performance characteristics of a network interconnection
   device that processes IPv6 routing extension headers.  The results of
   the test procedure can be used to compare the performance of the
   Compressed Routing Header (CRH) with the performance of other routing
   extension headers and with the performance of packets that do not
   include routing extension headers.  The routing extension headers
   that may be compared with the CRH using the test procedure are the
   Segment Routing Header (SRH) and Routing Header Type 0 (RH0).

1.  Introduction

   IPv6 [RFC8200] source nodes use routing extension headers to specify
   the path that packets follow to reach their destination.  The first
   routing extension header to be defined was Routing Header Type 0
   (RH0) [RFC2460].  This header was deprecated [RFC5095] and removed
   from current IPv6 implementations because it introduced security
   vulnerabilities.

   Two replacements to RH0 have been proposed, the Segment Routing
   Header (SRH) [RFC8754] and the Compressed Routing Header (CRH)
   [I-D.draft-bonica-6man-comp-rtg-hdr].  Both of these routing
   extension headers provide a superset of the functionality that was
   previously provided by RH0, and both address the security
   vulnerabilities of RH0.

   Both RH0 and the SRH specify intermediate nodes in the routing
   extension header as a list of 128-bit IPv6 addresses.  The
   disadvantage of this is that routing headers may become very large,
   which may impose data transmission overhead and degrade router
   performance (see section 1 of [I-D.draft-bonica-6man-comp-rtg-hdr]).
   For this reason, in the CRH, intermediate nodes are specified using
   16-bit or 32-bit short identifiers which are mapped to IPv6 addresses
   by intermediate routers.

   For a given router, it is possible that either the SRH or the CRH
   would result in better performance.  Processing a packet that uses
   the SRH requires the router to copy a larger header; however,
   processing a packet that uses the CRH requires the router to perform
   a lookup to translate the short identifier into an IPv6 address.

   This document defines a procedure that can be used to compare the
   performance of the CRH against other routing extension headers,
   namely: the SRH, RH0, and packets without routing extension headers.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Test Procedure

   The performance characteristics of routing extension headers on a
   given device under test (DUT) SHOULD be measured following the
   guidelines in [RFC2544], except as specified in the following
   sections.  The set of tests that is run SHOULD include a throughput
   test, and MAY also include other tests that are specified in
   [RFC2544].

3.1.  DUT Setup

   The DUT to be tested MUST be able to process each of the routing
   extension headers whose performance will be compared.  To get the
   most useful results, both the CRH and the SRH SHOULD be included.  If
   possible, both 16-bit and 32-bit versions of the CRH SHOULD be
   included.  RH0 and packets without a routing extension header MAY be
   included as well for comparison.

   The CRH has limited support in current IPv6 implementations, so the
   requirement to support the CRH is likely to be the most difficult to
   fulfill.  Juniper Networks has produced implementations of the CRH in
   the Linux kernel and in the MX-series router (see section 11 of
   [I-D.draft-bonica-6man-comp-rtg-hdr]).  However, these
   implementations currently support only the 16-bit version of the CRH.

   If the CRH is included in tests, then the router MUST have at least
   one SID configured to map to the tester's IP address.  This SID MUST
   be used in the CRH to cause the router to forward the packet back to
   the tester (or receiver, if separate transmitting and receiving
   devices are used).

   As per [RFC2544], configuration changes MUST NOT be made to the
   router between different tests.

3.2.  Independent Variables

   The performance characteristics of routing extension header
   processing may be affected by several factors, which SHOULD be used
   as independent variables in the test procedure:

   o  The type of routing extension header in use (the CRH, the SRH,
      RH0, or none).

   o  For the CRH, whether 16-bit or 32-bit short identifiers are used.

   o  For the CRH, the SRH, and RH0, the number of addresses (or, for
      the CRH, short identifiers) specified in the header.  This
      variable SHOULD range at least from 1 to 15, but MAY include
      higher values if desired.

   o  The number of data bytes included in the packets that are sent.
      This variable SHOULD take on the same set of values for each
      permutation of the other independent variables.  See the
      discussion of frame sizes below.

   Each test SHOULD be run for every possible combination of the
   independent variables.

3.3.  Header Contents

   No extension headers should be used except for the routing extension
   headers being tested.  Only one extension header at a time should be
   used.

   The next segment in the SRH and RH0 MUST be the IP address of the
   tester (or, when using separate transmitting and receiving devices,
   the receiver).  The next segment in the CRH MUST be an SID that the
   DUT has been configured to map to the IP address of the tester (or
   receiver).  This configuration MUST be done before starting any
   tests.

   Apart from the next segment for the SRH and RH0, the IP addresses
   used in the CRH, the SRH, and RH0 should be selected randomly as
   outlined in appendix C of [RFC2544] from the ranges reserved for this
   purpose by IANA.

3.4.  Frame Sizes

   The performance characteristics of routing extension headers may vary
   depending on frame size.  Section 9 of [RFC2544] provides guidelines
   for selecting frame sizes.  However, different routing extension
   headers use different amounts of space to encode the same
   information.  In particular, the CRH uses less space to encode
   information about intermediate nodes than the SRH and RH0.  For this
   reason, a fair comparison between two routing extension headers uses
   the same payload size for each rather than the same frame size for
   each.

   The set of payload sizes for the tests SHOULD be chosen so that the
   resulting set of frame sizes for each routing extension header and
   each number of addresses follows the guidelines set out in [RFC2544]
   as closely as possible.

4.  IANA Considerations

   No IANA actions required.

5.  Security Considerations

   No security considerations.
